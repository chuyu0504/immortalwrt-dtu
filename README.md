# Project ImmortalWrt

This device tree is based on the official **ImmortalWrt v25.12.2** release
(`4fc16f2985a358bd43bb522e43f05395fcbd6ed5`), using Linux 6.12.103.
The official packages and LuCI feeds are pinned to the exact revisions shipped
with that release. Do not update this tree from master.

The TAS-682F / IT-694_s3 release seed is `configs/tastek-mt76x8.config`.
The independent ECM30 seed is `configs/ebyte-ecm30.config`. Linux 6.12 NAND boot,
the factory 8 KiB / 512 KiB geometry, SquashFS with a UBIFS overlay, and
configuration-preserving sysupgrade have been verified on hardware. A RAM
recovery image is built alongside the NAND firmware.
See [the migration notes](docs/immortalwrt-25.12.2.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
for the release workflow.

ImmortalWrt is a fork of [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org), with more packages ported, more devices supported, default optimized profiles and localization modifications for mainland China users.<br/>
Compared to upstream, we allow to use (non-upstreamable) modifications/hacks to provide better feature/performance/support.

## Download
Built firmware images are available for many architectures and come with a package selection to be used as WiFi home router. To quickly find a factory image usable to migrate from a vendor stock firmware to ImmortalWrt, try the *Firmware Selector*.

If your device is supported, please follow the **Info** link to see install instructions or consult the support resources listed below.

## Development
To build your own firmware you need a GNU/Linux, BSD or macOS system (case sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack of a case sensitive file system.<br/>

  ### Requirements
  To build with this project, Debian 11 is preferred. And you need use the CPU based on AMD64 architecture, with at least 4GB RAM and 25 GB available disk space. Make sure the __Internet__ is accessible.

  The following tools are needed to compile ImmortalWrt, the package names vary between distributions.

  - Here is an example for Debian/Ubuntu users:<br/>
    - Method 1:
      <details>
        <summary>Setup dependencies via APT</summary>

        ```bash
        sudo apt update -y
        sudo apt full-upgrade -y
        sudo apt install -y ack antlr3 asciidoc autoconf automake autopoint binutils bison build-essential \
          bzip2 ccache clang cmake cpio curl device-tree-compiler ecj fastjar flex gawk gettext gcc-multilib \
          g++-multilib git gnutls-dev gperf haveged help2man intltool lib32gcc-s1 libc6-dev-i386 libelf-dev \
          libglib2.0-dev libgmp3-dev libltdl-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses-dev libpython3-dev \
          libreadline-dev libssl-dev libtool libyaml-dev libz-dev lld llvm lrzsz mkisofs msmtp nano \
          ninja-build p7zip p7zip-full patch pkgconf python3 python3-pip python3-ply python3-docutils \
          python3-pyelftools qemu-utils re2c rsync scons squashfs-tools subversion swig texinfo uglifyjs \
          upx-ucl unzip vim wget xmlto xxd zlib1g-dev zstd
        ```
      </details>
    - Method 2:
      ```bash
      sudo bash -c 'bash <(curl -s https://build-scripts.immortalwrt.org/init_build_environment.sh)'
      ```

  Note:
  - Builds may run as an unprivileged user or as root. For root builds, the top-level Makefile automatically exports `FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1` to host-tool configure scripts and recursive build commands. Other prerequisite checks remain enabled; `FORCE=1` is not required.
  - Use one account consistently for a build checkout so generated files remain writable by that account.
  - Using CPUs based on other architectures should be fine to compile ImmortalWrt, but more hacks are needed - No warranty at all.
  - You must __not__ have spaces or non-ascii characters in PATH or in the work folders on the drive.
  - If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (or WSL), removing Windows folders from PATH is required, please see [Build system setup WSL](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/wsl) documentation.
  - Using macOS as the host build OS is __not__ recommended. No warranty at all. You can get tips from [Build system setup macOS](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/buildroot.exigence.macosx) documentation.
  - For more details, please see [Build system setup](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem) documentation.

  ### Quickstart
  1. Run `git clone -b codex/immortalwrt-25.12.2 --single-branch --filter=blob:none https://github.com/hyird/immortalwrt-dtu.git` to clone this device tree.
  2. Run `cd immortalwrt` to enter source directory.
  3. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain the pinned official feeds.
  4. Run `./scripts/install-tas-feeds.sh` to install the selected packages and their dependencies.
  5. Run `cp configs/tastek-mt76x8.config .config && make defconfig` to select the TAS-682F and IT-694_s3 release profiles.
  6. Run `make` to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the GNU/Linux kernel & all chosen applications for your target system.

  ### Related Repositories
  The main repository uses multiple sub-repositories to manage packages of different categories. All packages are installed via the OpenWrt package manager called opkg. If you're looking to develop the web interface or port packages to ImmortalWrt, please find the fitting repository below.
  - [LuCI Web Interface](https://github.com/immortalwrt/luci): Modern and modular interface to control the device via a web browser.
  - [ImmortalWrt Packages](https://github.com/immortalwrt/packages): Community repository of ported packages.
